{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Have you gotten any estimates?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Carl..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Hey Carl, its okay...it's cool man, I'm a detective. Clear the crime scene and let me think...meteors did it! That'll be $20."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Hey, Carl."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I have not called for you, Frylock.  What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I live here."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Well, quit hovering. I am the leader!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Man, your car is messed up! How are you going to get to work, Carl?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Frylock, send Carl to work, then we shall solve this mystery and make $20."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Quickly, Carl, the ray is upon you. Where do you work?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Send Carl to the home then!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"To the home!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Okay, that'll be $20."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"So, what now, Shake?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"We shall solve the mystery from Carl's pool!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Goin' to the bank!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"This is a fun pool. I do like splashing."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yes, playing is for pleasure. We should have a pool. Make us one from the sky. I command it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"[sarcasm] Yeah, yeah, I'll do that."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Seriously, I do command it"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I wonder who killed Carl's car."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"A car cannot be \"killed\"!  It was murdered by someone who is jealous of Carl's ability to drive. JEALOUSY is the motivation!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Dancing is forbidden!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Where are we going?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Shut your deformed mouth Meatwad, before I NAIL it shut!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"The scent seems to be coming from that mall"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I know!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"All right! I want some jeans!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"(pushes past him) I'M the one who wants some jeans!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"How did you get back there?! That's for salespersons only.  I want to get back there.  Get me back there!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Here. Take the Meat Bridge!  It's right here!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Meat Bridge?  No."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Fine. Don't take the Meat Bridge."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Well, as long as we don't go back to the lab."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I need to go back to the lab."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"God!  That'll take a thousand hours!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Does it LOOK like I'm OK?! Stand back, and I shall destroy him! SHAKE POWER ACTIVATE!  [Shake huffs and puffs and excretes a glob of milkshake onto the road]] Now come over here and slip on it, if you dare, rabbit!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I have called this meeting to say that downtown is no longer safe."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"So, in short, we need to pick some new restaurants and night clubs."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"[in the pool for the first time] Master Shake said it would dissolve me and then I would get clogged in the filter and then beavers would come and eat me.  But that hasn't happened yet!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Look, I have a brain! (pause) I just took it out so it wouldn't get wet!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Yeah, man. He took his brain out. It's cool!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"He told me to get in the freezer 'cause there was a carnival in there.  There was no carnival!  It was a damn freezer!  I got freezer burn and I got mushed up against a chicken."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Let's go.  They don't have nothin', it's like a flea market threw up in there."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Look, a Bananarama tape!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"That's mine!  Drop it where you are!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"You don't need a machine to make a rainbow, for rainbows are made of happy thoughts, and dreams, and chocolate unicorns, and gumdrops, and licorice sunsets, and fuzzy gumdrop bears, in Sugar-Covered Chocolate Gumdrop Land."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"No way in hell."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"All right!  The real rainbow!  I did it!  I brought happiness and joy to us all!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Wow!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well, I gotta go...see ya later."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Good morning, Carl!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"We are truly sorry, Carl, and it will probably never happen again.  Can we have our cord back?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Memphis."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh, it was very nice. They light up the bridge. We had fried catfish."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"When did you have fried catfish?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"What have you done with him?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You know, we have a cloner."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Oh, no- the cloner!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"The brownies!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"My brownies!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Run! To the pool!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You put a brownie in my cloning device, didn't you?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"No! Yes. I don't know. Maybe! Look, that was six weeks ago! I locked the door; let 'em just duke it out."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad' would say","completion":"You didn't lock the door, it was out in the yard...!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yes, Meatwad, with actions!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"The finger? Like this? (turns into a hot-dog)"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Yeah? What about it?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Oh yeah? Well, I only see two."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I don't think Meatwad should be hanging around with these Moon people."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I don't think I should be playing with these medium strings. I need light gauge if I'm gonna thrash!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Grab my potatoes, Carl!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Why didn’t you say so! It's probably dry by now, so let's go get it. [saying as he gets into the dryer] Now remember, I like it spicy!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Hey, wait a second! Why's it spinnin'?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Ooh.  Damn!  What dimension was that?  Carl, your hands!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Shake, where is my popsicle?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"I require a popsicle every 15 minutes! You obviously did not read the memo!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"(zaps Shake) You sicken me with your lies."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"\"Make\" me some? Please do not insult what little intelligence I have. I need it now."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwadbitch would say","completion":"Yes you will. Now what is the magic word, bitch?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"That's right. (releases Shake; Shake runs out the door) You better run, boy! And bring back some chocolate syrup, too, or your fate is sealed!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Everybody hates me 'cause they die or get hurt."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Will this hurt 'im?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"It shouldn't."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Then why are we doing it?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"[Chasing Meatwad with pencils] This is for shooting me in the roof and sending me to the store making me call you sire!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Go destroy Balloonenstein!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Do what now?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Pop the balloon with the glass!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Yeah, yeah, okay. [long pause] Do what now?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Pop him with the glass! The glass in your head!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Yeah, yeah, I know. Don't yell at me! [pause] Do what now?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Damn it, he needs his brain. Otherwise he \"just gonna float around forever sayin' \"Do what now?\""}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Do what now?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Guess what? He's not gettin his brain back, because it is now the nerve center for the city of the future: LAS BRAINGELES!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"(now a 50 foot meatball, speaking in a booming voice) Where are my popsicles?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Damn!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"(scared) Is that you, God?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Frylock, get away from the pool."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Aw, hell... (moves away from the pool)"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"(leaps into the air) CAN OPENER!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"World domination?  You guys couldn't take over a damn bowl of Jell-O!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Okay, look, which one of these buttons beams me out of here?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shake, how did you get in this beam?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh, go ahead, I'm not there, ah, it's fine."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You cannot cut someone's lawn with matches, Meatwad!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Look, I know that.  You gotta have gasoline, otherwise how's it gonna spread to the street?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Oh, is he mad? Don't open it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Uh, Shake..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Carl is here..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"[after Carl's house has burned down] Hey Carl, you want me to shampoo the rug?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"So you can give me some money."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You ever hear of a refrigerator, or a frickin' trash can?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"No."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You got three raw chickens in here on the floor! A dog wouldn't even take a crap in here!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Look, just take the hose and lightly spray everything out the back door."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"No, no MY ASS, YOU WILL!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Drape a tarp over it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Oh no you're not! You're gonna go to the damn store and get some cleaning supplies!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"What's goin' on?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Look at this mess! Did you do this? [long pause] Fine, alright!. I'll do it, but it's my decision to do this, I declare it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"This here's Vanessa.  I know she looks like an apple, but she's actually a full-grown woman, and she fell in love with her boyfriend, Dewey, here, and they go off into outer space and then they... they get married."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"(angrily enters the house) Where's Meatwad?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"What're you doing with that gutter?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"What're you doin' with that beard, huh? Answer that, scientist!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"My telescope! And you've ruined it! How will I ever see the stars again?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"This ain't no telescope, it's Dewey. He's an engineer, and he works on the Supertrain."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"He does what?! You've got mental problems. [Hits Meatwad repeatedly with gutter] Taste the chrome!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Your mother's... [sees Ol' Drippy for the first time] AAAHHHH, MONSTER!!!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Was it made of cardboard, used to be up at the liquor store?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shake, what is wrong with you?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"What's wrong with you? Hey, why don't you go kiss your new best friend, you love him so damn much! I'm the one who cleaned the kitchen. I'm the authority!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh Carl, you didn't mess with it did ya? Cause it's gotta set up for a couple days with the battery."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yeah, you know, the one from your car. I dumped some shampoo in there too, but it's dog shampoo so I dunno if it's gonna work, but were prayin' like hell that it does."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"What? I'm a little what?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"[agreeing with Carl] That's right!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"[agreeing with both Frylock and Carl] Yeah, Shake. That's right!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh yeah, he's nice now, but don't come looking for me when he's burying your bodies out in the desert."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well, get out of here! What are you waiting on? I’m gonna chase you outta here!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Well, Shake! I thought you moved."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"He needs an ass-whooping is what he needs."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Drippy, don’t! What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Don’t do that, that’s going to hurt you!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Well, I have some penicillin in my lab if that’s what this is all about."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Where are you going, Drippy? I- I love you!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"He's in the grill of the truck!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"He was my best friend."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Ah, man."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Did he really?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well...I guess I'll have one of those wings then. Gimme one."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Where's the meat?! This is a bone!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"How am I ever gonna win that ten speed?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"How are you ever gonna ride a ten speed with no frickin' legs?! You're just gonna bust the ass that you don't even have! Who bothered to spawn you...and why?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"I do not want to do anything illegal here, but I would kill somebody in front of their own mama to get a ten speed and if anybody testifies against me, I'll gouge their eyes out."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Yeah, we'll get a basket and a horn on the handle."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Oh, yeah baby! That's a neat car she's washin'! You think that's a straight six?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"But, this is where Carl keeps his clothes."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well, I guess so.."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"[listening to Bach] Yeah, now listen to that beat. Now that's a kickin' glissando!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"It was your other neighbor."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"[notices Carl's mouth is full] What you eating there, Carl? (walks over to him) You gonna show me some love?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Is that why your teeth are blue?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh. Uh... So, why are you..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Trick or treat, smell my meat...[Carl shuts the door]] ...Ah, man."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Look, I need candy. Now, are you going to give me some, or are you going to lose some teeth?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Shhh... I don't listen to that kiddie crap any more, I'm check'n the adult jams now, see, check it. MC Pee Pants don't just want candy now, that's childish, he needs it.  And when you need something that's a responsibility, that only only an adult... of my maturity... bunnies!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You know Meatwad and Carl have been hanging out quite a bit lately."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine, but don't think it's a little bit weird that they started washing the car at midnight...and they're still doing it?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shake, did you hear this lyric? About drilling a hole straight to hell, and releasing demons to create a global diet pill pyramid scheme?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Eh, I don't know. All that rap is is clicks and whistles."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Get up!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You're all the things that are in this ad: you're energetic, hard-working, you like people—"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"They don't use ships, they use rocket boots."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Frylock, where are the pills?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Pills? What do you need pills for?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well, Happy-Time Harry needs 'em. He says that the pills make the phone calls go away."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"[Writes on a post-it note] Alright Meatwad, this is a prescription from Dr. Frylock for Jolly Sunshine Happiness!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Oh, you think this is a game?! They're gonna garnish his wages and how's he gonna pay child support then, huh? I'll tell ya, he ain't!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I was gonna make margaritas with that!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"[To Meatwad] Tomorrow I'm getting you a new doll with a sunnier attitude!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Dialysis?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I told you I'd do it, I'm gonna do it now. Hey Meatwad, look at this! [With Shake turned away, Harry pours gasoline over himself] Come to the window! Big time fun... you know what I mean?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Well.. shoot... I mean I was just going to sort of blow your jaw off with a firecracker or something.. I wasn't gonna.. I think I need to go pray."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"You know, Happy-Time...Just being around you kinda makes me wanna die..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You’re gonna chuck him off a cliff? Shake, we could have chucked him off the roof and stayed at home."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"No, This is a magic cliff here, like in The Highlander. So, you will become The Highlander, and you’ll roam the earth forever, trying to kill yourself, but you wouldn’t be able to, because you’ll be…immortal. Won’t that suck, little man? [laughs]"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well actually, That sounds kinda cool."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yeah, it does."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Then I’m gonna do it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"NO, YOU’RE NOT! I’m doing it!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shake, Wait! The Highlander was just a movie. I mean-"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh Frylock, The Highlander was a documentary, and the events happen in real time."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"So, this cliff is magic?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh yeah, Big time."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"I’m doing it now."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"See, he saw the movie too."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"You know, that’s right."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I know, I saw cliffs, Okay. And there’s lots of magic everywhere…And Mel Gibson."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh, You think you’re the expert? Let's see how much your ass know about FLYING! [throws Happy-Time off a cliff.] Yeah! that’s what I’m talking about."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You done? Because that took forever..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"I am-Well I am foreverrr.....I AM IMMORTAL!!!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shake, No! [Master Shake jumps off the cliff, his straw clinging to a branch]"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Damn branch…Wait! I'm not immortal here, Okay?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Hang on Shake, we'll call for help!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"No, tell him to let go."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yeah, Hurry! I think that the branch will hold for... [branch breaks] IT'S NOT HOLDING!!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"(Floating in the pool with Meatwad) So, I guess the Highlander comes out of traction today."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Well, I hoped they fixed his eyes. They got messed up pretty bad in that fall."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Well, the doctors gave him some hard plastic replacements, So don't stare at them, Okay? He’s real self conscious about it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Okay."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Oh! There you are!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Where are you?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Dang! What happened to your eyes?! They look weird."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shhh!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"We grillin' tonight."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Look at him and tell me there's a God."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"He made me in His own image."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Oh, yeah, God's a big meatball, I forgot.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"He is."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Does he stink like you do?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":" Yeah, that's right.  And he ain't my best friend, neither.  He yells at me and scares me and locks me in the attic, and pours liquid on my head that stink, and freeze me with the fire extinguisher, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember 'cause he shocked me in the head with a car battery.  [pause] With a bunch of clamps, and sparks, and ..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Oh, you're ki — Meatwad, it's not polite to stare."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"But, look at him."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"No i-it's cool, I was just wondering if that jambox worked, you know.  Shake threw mine in a cobra cage, and dared me to go get it, and that's why I'm all puffy back here."}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Yelloo?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Master Shake would say","completion":"Look, brother, these ain't nothin but disco lights."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Did they not see us sitting here?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"So, is he like replicating it?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"No, he's hotwiring it."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Oh, shoot I was hoping I'd learn something.  Science is a mystery to man, isn't it Frylock?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Yeah it sure is Meatwad..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Like how we all evolved from the ancient dinosaur.  I wish I had some of their stuff boy.  Like them tail. Them tails that make 'em fly."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Shut up, Damn!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"So, did they, um … ever find your car?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Uh, well, it wasn't Shake, Carl.  He was abducted by aliens earlier this afternoon."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"He was … seriously."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"What?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"So is this where the camp is?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Smells like vomit."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Okay Shake, see you in a week."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Hey Randy, I don't know what's going on, but can I trade bunks? 'Cause my roommate's...wha- are those his organs?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"...I-I-I don't like this camp. Can I go home now?"}

{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"I don't think so Carl."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"You sold Meatwad to the circus, didn't you?!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"How much, Shake?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Two? Two what?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Wow, the crowd is really getting off on this."}

{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"No"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Which bar?"}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"Listen to me Randy, it doesn't matter if you're white, or black, or a sasquatch even. As long as you follow your dreams, no matter how crazy or against the law it is. Except for sasquatch, if you're a sasquatch the rules are different."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"...Whatever."}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":"Yeah, turn into that Igloo!"}
{"prompt":"Say something Frylock would say","completion":" Carl..."}
{"prompt":"Say something Meatwad would say","completion":"And I'll tell you something else Frylock, I did not see one computer in that whole camp."}
